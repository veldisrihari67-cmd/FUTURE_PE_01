# 🛠️ Task 1: AI Automation & Prompt Engineering Workflow

This document records the exact prompt chain and technical refinements used to create the video: **"5 AI Tools You Must Learn NOW—Before Your Job Disappears in 2025."**


## STEP 1: BRAINSTORMING & STRATEGY (P-1)

### 📝 The Prompt
Act as a highly experienced Digital Content Strategist specializing in YouTube career content. Your task is to plan a viral video titled around the topic '5 AI Tools That Can Replace a Full-Time Job (in 2025).' First, generate 10 unique, high-impact titles using the following elements: scarcity, urgency, specific numbers, and strong verbs. Second, provide the specific 60-second Hook needed to retain the audience and a structured outline for the 5 key tools to be discussed.

### ✅ The Result
* **Selected Title:** 5 AI Tools You Must Learn NOW—Before Your Job Disappears in 2025
* **Viral Hook:** “If you think AI tools are only for small tasks… you’re already behind. Because in 2025, there are AI tools that aren’t just helping with work—they’re replacing entire full-time jobs...”
* **Tools Identified:** ChatGPT 5, Midjourney v7, Synthesia, AutoGPT, and Tability.


## STEP 2: SCRIPT GENERATION & PICTORY OPTIMIZATION (P-2)

**Objective:** Transform the outline into a long-form script, then optimize it specifically for Pictory.ai to fix word-breakage and incorrect scene generation.

### Part A: Initial Generation Prompt
"Use the following specific title and outline to write a complete, detailed YouTube video script between 1200 and 1500 words in a professional, authoritative, but fast-paced tone. The script must be structured with explicit sections: [Hook], [Intro], [Tools 1-5], and [Conclusion/CTA]. For every tool, include visual cues using ALL CAPS (e.g., [VISUAL: FAST CUT]) to match the tool's function."

### Part B: Technical Optimization (The "Fix" Prompt)
*I encountered issues where Pictory was reading visual cues out loud and creating 190+ tiny scenes. I used this follow-up prompt to fix the production errors:*

**Prompt:**
"The previous script is causing errors in Pictory.ai. It created too many scenes (190+) and the AI voice is reading the [VISUAL] tags. Please rewrite the script into a 100% 'Pictory-Ready' Voiceover file:
1. Remove all brackets and visual cues—ONLY include the spoken text.
2. Shorten the script to reach a target video length of ~4-5 minutes.
3. Break text into short, clean paragraphs to ensure Pictory generates roughly 35–45 scenes.
4. Fix Pacing: Ensure sentences flow naturally for AI voice delivery."

### ✅ The Result (Final Produced Script)
**HOOK:** If you think AI tools are only for small tasks, you’re already behind. In 2025, AI tools aren’t just helping with work. They are replacing entire full-time jobs...
**INTRO:** Welcome back to the channel. This is where we break down the AI tools that actually matter...
**TOOL 1:** ChatGPT 5 is no longer just a chatbot. It can replace content writers and research assistants...
[The full script continues for 5 minutes and 35 seconds of content].


## STEP 3: THUMBNAIL DESIGN (P-3)

### 📝 The Prompt
"Based on the completed video script, define the optimal YouTube thumbnail that maximizes click-through rate (CTR). Provide two clear deliverables: 1. The exact, urgent Text Overlay (max 5 words). 2. A detailed DALL·E 3 image prompt focusing on an individual looking anxious/shocked, contrasted against a futuristic screen displaying '5' and a red 'REPLACED' graphic."

### ✅ The Result
* **Text Overlay:** “5 Jobs REPLACED by AI”
* **DALL·E 3 Prompt:** A cinematic, high-contrast scene showing a young professional standing in the foreground with an anxious expression. Behind them, a massive futuristic digital wall displays a giant glowing number “5” in bold neon, with a large red “REPLACED” stamp flashing across it. Cinematic color grading, sharp contrast, volumetric lighting.
