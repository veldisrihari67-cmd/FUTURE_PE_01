# FUTURE_PE_01
Prompt Engineering Internship - Task-1 AI- Powered YouTube Script and Thumbnail Generator.

## Task 1: End-to-End AI Video Automation 
## Project Overview
The goal of this task was to demonstrate the power of **Prompt Engineering** to automate the creation of high-quality, long-form video content. By utilizing a structured prompt chain, I transformed a single concept into a complete, YouTube-ready video including a 1200+ word script, AI-generated visuals, and a high-CTR thumbnail.

## Tech Stack
LLM: ChatGPT (Prompt Chaining & Scripting)
Video Engine: Pictory AI (Script-to-Video Automation)
Graphic Design: Canva (Thumbnail Refinement)
AI Imagery: DALL·E 3 (Base Thumbnail Generation)
  
## The Prompt Chain
I used a 3-step prompt sequence to ensure the output remained high-quality and contextually consistent.

| **Phase** | **Prompt ID** | **Objective** |

| **Brainstorming** | **P-1** | Identified the viral topic: "5 AI Tools That Can Replace a Full-Time Job." |

| **Scripting** | **P-2** | Generated a 1200+ word script with cinematic voiceover cues and B-roll instructions. |

| **Visual Assets** | **P-3** | Created a high-impact DALL·E 3 prompt for a realistic, urgent thumbnail image. |

## Final Deliverables
* **Video Length:** 4 Minutes 20 Seconds
* **Topic:** 5 AI Tools You Must Learn NOW
* **Key Features:** Automated AI Voiceover, Keyword-matched B-roll, and Dynamic Captions.

## Final Thumbnail
The thumbnail was engineered for high Click-Through Rate (CTR). It utilizes high-contrast yellow text layered over an AI-generated neon-glow background, creating a sense of urgency and professional polish.

## Key Learnings
* **Prompt Chaining:** Learned how to break down complex tasks into sequential prompts to maintain AI "memory" and quality across long-form outputs.
* **Visual Integration:** Mastered the process of syncing AI-generated scripts with automated stock footage and custom AI assets.
* **Content Optimization:** Applied psychological triggers (urgency, high-contrast colors) to design effective social media assets.
